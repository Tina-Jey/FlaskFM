# FlaskFM
Codecademy project

-> It's a project about creating a web sercice called FlaskFM. It will allow the users to add songs to their personalized list from a song library.
- will model users and playlists. Playlists can be changed by user who can add or remove songs
- focus on database aspects

-> I'm having following problems with the code:
  - initializing the db by db.create_all() - doesn't work ATM
  - RuntimeError: Working outside of application context.

-> I'm learning about what I need to run the app actually (sorry)
